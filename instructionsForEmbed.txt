include the right path

don't forget to do:
right click on project (in solution explorer)
go to properties
get to configuration properties
then linker
then input
and under first box (Additional Dependencies), add path to python27.lib (or python36.lib) and then semicolon
stuff;stuff;things;C:\folder1\folder2\Python27\libs\python27.lib


THIS IS THE COMMAND THAT WORKED!!!
argv[0] (i think)           argv[1]           argv[2]  argv[others]
for python 3.6 do this: .\EmbeddingPython.exe TPP.testingPyProgram multiply 2 3
TPP is a folder and testingPyProgram is a .py file inside the folder
for python 2.7 do this: .\EmbeddingPython.exe "testingPyProgram" multiply 2 3
testingPyProgram is a .py file inside the same place as the .exe file

argv[0] = the program to run
argv[1] = the module/script to call
argv[2] = the function to use
argv[others] = inputs to function



*****I might be missing some instructions. sorry
